# Pipeline
Whole Genome Sequencing data from sampling performed in 16 locations on the east coast.

Filtered reads (removing double mapped reads) were used for identifying duplications using a strutural variant prediction method DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012). Additional filtration was performed by removing duplications mapped to highly repetitive regions of the genome as identified using RepeatMasker (http://repeatmasker.org) and fixed duplications.
